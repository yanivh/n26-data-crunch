Optimized Solution Explanation:

   - Uses window functions to look at previous and next rows
   - Eliminates need for multiple CTEs or temp tables
   - All comparisons done in a single pass

   - Detects changes by comparing with previous row
   - Keeps only rows where attributes change
   - Uses next row's start date as current row's end date
   - Automatically handles gaps and overlaps

   - FIRST_VALUE: Gets the first sk_agrmnt_id for each group
   - LAG: Compares current row with previous row
   - LEAD: Gets the start date of next group for end date
   - DISTINCT: Removes duplicates automatically

Key Points Demonstrated:
1. Records 2-3 merged (same attributes)
2. Records 6-7-8 merged (same attributes)
3. Maintains correct date ranges
4. Preserves earliest sk_agrmnt_id
5. Handles multiple agreements
6. Preserves 9999-12-31 end dates
