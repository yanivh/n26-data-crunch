# Feature Table Computation

This directory contains different implementations and optimizations for the feature table computation task.

## Files:
1. `main.sql` - Primary implementation using window functions
2. `alternative_solutions.sql` - Other approaches (self-join and correlated subquery)
3. `optimizations.sql` - Performance optimization suggestions

## Usage:
- For most cases, use the implementation in `main.sql`
- For smaller datasets or when readability is priority, consider solutions in `alternative_solutions.sql`
- Apply optimizations from `optimizations.sql` based on your specific needs

## Performance Considerations:
- Window function approach: O(N log N)
- Self-join approach: O(N²)
- Correlated subquery: O(N²)

## Implementation Notes:
- Main solution uses efficient window functions
- Alternative solutions provided for comparison
- Optimization suggestions for different scenarios
